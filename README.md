# MCQ_GENERAL_KNOWLEDGE_QUIZ
This Python script is a terminal-based Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) Quiz App designed to test basic computer literacy and Python programming concepts. The program initializes a tracking variable named score at zero and then proceeds through a linear sequence of 20 questions. For each question, it uses the print() function to display the prompt and four possible options, followed by the input() function to capture the user's choice. The core logic relies on conditional branching (if-else statements), where the program compares the user's input to the correct letter key; if they match, the score is incremented by one and a "Correct" message is displayed, otherwise, it informs the user the answer was "Wrong."

Technically, the code serves as a practical demonstration of sequential execution and case-insensitive input handling. By using the .lower() method on the input, the code becomes more robust, preventing errors if a user types an uppercase letter. The script is structured to run from top to bottom, ensuring every user encounters the same set of questions in a fixed order. At the conclusion of the final question, the program utilizes string concatenation to output the final calculated score out of twenty, providing the user with immediate performance feedback. This makes it an ideal beginner-level project for understanding how variables, data types, and control structures interact in a real-world script.
